📊 Startup Profit Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression
This project uses Multiple Linear Regression to predict the profit of a startup based on different expenditures like R&D Spend, Administration, and Marketing Spend, using the 50_Startups.csv dataset.

📁 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains 50 startup records with the following columns:

R&D Spend: Money spent on research and development

Administration: Money spent on administration

Marketing Spend: Money spent on marketing

State: The location of the startup (categorical feature)

Profit: The target variable to predict
